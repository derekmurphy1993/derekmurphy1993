### Welcome

I am a front end developer passionate about bridging compelling design with real world solutions. Whether it be visualizing data or creating an intuitive tool that makes everyday tasks a little bit easier, I aim to make technology work for people.

In the past Iâ€™ve worked a variety of roles, from designer at an aquatic leisure company to a managing a craft brewery. These experiences inspired me to find ways technology can help improve daily life and helped me develop a diverse skill set in design, communication, and problem-solving.

Outside of work, you can find me at the local hack night, or cycling around the city, exploring and photographing new neighborhoods.

#### Currently studying: MERN stack / NODEJS
