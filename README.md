### Welcome

Iâ€™m Derek, a software developer who loves taking on conceptual ideas and turning them into solvable problems. I enjoy working with a team dedicated towards a common goal, where creativity and growth is encouraged along the way. Iâ€™ve worked in roles in the service industry and graphic design, where organizing priorities, quick thinking, and hard work is key. I am most inspired by the way seemingly small technologies can have a huge impact on the people and communities they serve. More than anything, I thrive in result driven roles where I can build something I am proud of. 

Special interest in projects related to healthcare, transportation and logistics. 

#### Currently studying: React
