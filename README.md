### Welcome

Iâ€™m Derek, a software developer who loves taking on conceptual ideas and turning them into solvable problems. I enjoy working with a team dedicated towards a common goal, where creativity and growth is encouraged along the way. Iâ€™ve primarily worked on react based web aplications. I also have a background in graphic design, giving me a careful eye for detail and the ability to communicate across teams, especially UI/UX. While front-end development is my strong suit, I am venturing more into developing a full stack mindset.

I am most inspired by the way seemingly small technologies can have a huge impact on the people and communities they serve. More than anything, I thrive in collabrative driven roles where I can build intuitive tools to help others efficiently work. 

Special interest in projects related to enterprise software, especially in the fields of food/agriculture, transportation and logistics. 

#### Currently studying: NodeJs
