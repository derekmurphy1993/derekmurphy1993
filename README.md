### Welcome

I am a front end developer passionate about bridging compelling design with real world solutions. Whether it be visualizing data or creating an intuitive tool that makes everyday tasks a little bit easier, I aim to make technology work for people.

In the past I’ve worked a variety of roles, from designer at an aquatic leisure company to a managing a craft brewery. These experiences inspired me to find ways technology can help improve daily life and helped me develop a diverse skill set in design, communication, and problem-solving.
